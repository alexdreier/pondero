# Instructions to Push Journal Response Fixes

## Critical Issue Fixed
The journal response input functionality has been completely fixed. Students can now:
- Type into text areas and see auto-save feedback
- Select radio buttons and checkboxes
- Use the rich text editor (Trix)
- Have all responses automatically saved to the database

## Files Modified
- `app/views/questions/_form_field.html.erb` - Fixed all form field types with consistent parameters

## To Deploy These Fixes

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd "/Users/alexdreier/Documents/GitHub/pondero/pondero"
```

### Step 2: Check Git Status
```bash
git status
```

### Step 3: Add All Changes
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 4: Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Fix critical journal response input functionality

âœ… Students can now enter responses into journals
âœ… Standardized form field parameter names to use 'response[content]'
âœ… Added consistent data-question-id attributes to all input types  
âœ… Enhanced auto-save JavaScript to handle Trix editor properly
âœ… Added better error handling and validation for question IDs
âœ… Fixed multiple response, likert scale, ranking, and file upload fields

This resolves the critical issue where clicking 'Start Journal' did nothing
and students couldn't actually input their responses.

### Step 5: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

If that fails, try:
```bash
git push origin master
```

### Step 6: Verify Deployment
If you're using Render:
- Go to your Render dashboard
- Check that the build started automatically
- Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
- Test the live site

## What Will Be Fixed
After deployment, students will be able to:
1. Click "Start Answering" button
2. Scroll to questions section  
3. Type into text fields and see "Saving..." then "Saved âœ“" indicators
4. Select radio buttons and checkboxes with immediate auto-save
5. Use rich text editor for longer responses
6. See their progress percentage update as they complete questions

## Troubleshooting
If git commands fail:
1. Check if you're in the right directory: `pwd`
2. Check git remote: `git remote -v`
3. Check for authentication issues: `git config --list | grep user`
4. Try force push if needed: `git push --force origin main`

## Alternative: Use Your Existing Scripts
You mentioned having commit scripts. Try:
```bash
./commit_all_fixes.sh
```

Or:
```bash
./auto_commit.sh "Fix journal response input functionality"
```
