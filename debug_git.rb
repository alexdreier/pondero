✅ Students can now enter responses into journals
✅ Standardized form field parameter names to use 'response[content]'
✅ Added consistent data-question-id attributes to all input types  
✅ Enhanced auto-save JavaScript to handle Trix editor properly
✅ Added better error handling and validation for question IDs
✅ Fixed multiple response, likert scale, ranking, and file upload fields

This resolves the critical issue where clicking 'Start Journal' did nothing
and students couldn't actually input their responses.
